## Quiz 1
#Read in the dataset
hw1data <- read.csv("hw1_data.csv")

#What are the dataset column names?
colnames(hw1data)

#Extract the first two rows of the dataset and print them.
hw1data[1:2,]

#How many rows are in the dataset?
nrow(data)

#Extract the last two rows of the dataset and print them.
tail(hw1data)

#What is the Ozone value in the 47th row?
hw1data[47,1]

#How many missing values are in the Ozone column?
sum(!complete.cases(hw1data[,1]))

#What is the mean value of the Ozone column (excluding missing values)?
mean(hw1data[complete.cases(hw1data),1])

#What is mean Solar.R value of subset with Ozone > 31 and Temp > 90?
mean(subset(hw1data, Ozone>31 & Temp > 90)[,2])

#What is the mean of Temp when Month is 6?
mean(subset(hw1data, hw1data[,5]==6)[,4])

What was the max ozone value in the month of May (i.e. Month is equal to 5)?
> question20 <- subset(hw1data, Month==5 & !is.na(Ozone), select=Ozone)
> apply(question20, 2, max)
